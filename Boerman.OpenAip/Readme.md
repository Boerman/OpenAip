Boerman.OpenAip
===============

This library has been written to help parsing .aip files as available from the OpenAIP project. The OpenAIP project aims to have an open database which contains points of interest for aviation aides. The information available through the OpenAIP project includes:

- Airspace information
- Airports
- Navigation aides
- Soaring hotspots

At the time of writing only the parsing of airspace files is implemented.

In order to parse a .aip file, read the contents, and pass these to any of the `Boerman.OpenAip.Parsers.Airspace.Parse` methods.
